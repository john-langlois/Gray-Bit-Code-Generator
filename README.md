# Gray-Bit-Code-Generator

Generates Gray Code based in n-bits
Simply change the value of n in the main driver to whatever value of n is desired
This program was created to solve a question in my assignment where I had to find the 22nd 6-bit
Gray code, therefore, the 22nd gray code was also numbered on the side.
Hope you enjoy!
